## Top 50 Algorithms and Coding Interview Questions 

Without any further ado, here is my list of some of the **most frequently
asked coding interview questions from programming job interviews**:


## 1. Array Coding Interview Questions
An array is the most fundamental data structure, which stores elements at a contiguous memory location. It is also one of 
the darling topics of interviewers and you will hear a lot of questions about an array in any coding interview, e.g. 
reversing an array, sorting the array, or searching elements on the array.

The key benefit of an array data structure is that it offers fast O(1) search if you know the index, but adding and removing 
an element from an array is slow because you cannot change the size of the array once itâ€™s created.

In order to create a shorter or longer array, you need to create a new array and copy all elements from old to new.

The key to solving array-based questions is having a good knowledge of array data structure as well as basic programming 
constructors such as loop, recursion, and fundamental operators.

Here are some of the popular array-based coding interview questions for your practice:

1. How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?
